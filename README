My initial goal was to be able to take in 2nd order constraints (figure 1c) and
an invariant template for I, then make the necessary substitutions for the
invariant (I[...]), and finally run it with the z3 solver. However, I quickly
realized this was not easily doable in Python (writing a parser would probably
take up most of my time), so I settled with manually doing the substitutions and
put it in z3 format (which was suprisingly easy to use). The output (as
mentioned in class) is a little underwhelming.

This paper gave me a lot of headache and in the end didn't seem to be very
useful aside from toy problems like this. It's interesting nonetheless.
